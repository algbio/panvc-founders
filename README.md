# PanVC Experiments with Founder Sequences

We provide the following data files for use with PanVC.

## Take-one-out experiment with human chromosome 22

To do the experiment, please download the reads listed below and do one of the following:

* Download pre-generated indices (below) and run `panvc_call_variants`
* Download the founder sequences (below), prepare input for `panvc_index`, generate the index and run `panvc_call_variants`.

### Reads used in the experiment

The following archives contain the reads used in the experiment in gzip-compressed FASTQ format. (Hence the archives themselves are have not been re-compressed.)

| File | Coverage |
| ---- | -------- |
| [cov10.tar](https://cs.helsinki.fi/group/gsa/panvc-founders/take-one-out-experiment-with-human-chr22/reads/cov10.tar) | 10x |
| [cov20.tar](https://cs.helsinki.fi/group/gsa/panvc-founders/take-one-out-experiment-with-human-chr22/reads/cov20.tar) | 20x |
| [cov50.tar](https://cs.helsinki.fi/group/gsa/panvc-founders/take-one-out-experiment-with-human-chr22/reads/cov50.tar) | 50x |

### Indices for use with `panvc_call_variants`

The following archives contain indices generated with `panvc_index`.
